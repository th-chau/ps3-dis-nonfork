    "This dataset is from a pretty neat experiment that was conducted by some former graduate students at UC Berkeley (who once GSI'd for PS 3 several years ago!).\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set is the result of a large-scale field experiment conducted in 25 cities across Germany, during which 3,797 unknowing bystanders were exposed to brief social encounters with confederates who revealed their ideas regarding gender roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were a few aspects to the experiment. We'll cover only one of them in lecture today, and leave the other one for the in-class activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the authors:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our intervention was set up to observe the behavior of unknowing experimental subjects (bystanders) who are exposed to a highly realistic and carefully choreographed sequence of social encounters in public spaces. The intervention followed four steps:\n",
    "> 1. First, a female confederate approaches a bench at a train station where other individuals are waiting for their train and draws their attention by asking them a question (“Do you know if I can I buy tickets on the train?”). \n",
    "> 2. Shortly thereafter, and in the presence of the bystanders, the confederate receives a phone call (from one of the other confederates who was not acting in the specific iteration), and audibly converses with the caller in German...regarding a member of her family (her sister). The conversation is scripted in a manner that reveals the confederate's position on the women's right to choose to pursue a career versus having to stay home to take care of the family. **Note from Professor Broockman: this is the experimental manipulation we will describe below.**\n",
    "> 3. At the end of the phone call, a bag that the confederate was holding seemingly tears, making her drop a number of lemons, which disperse on the train platform and the confederate appears to be in need of assistance to pick them up. \n",
    "> 4. In the final step, team members who were not a part of the intervention record whether each bystander helped the confederate retrieve her lemons. A collage of photographs that capture the key sequences of our experimental intervention are presented in Figure 1.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ![](scene.jpg)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> _Figure 1: Unknowing bystanders watch and listen as the confederate takes a call and conducts a conversation with a friend (a), in the process revealing her attitudes toward the role of women in society (family and work). Following the phone call, the confederate drops her possessions (lemons), which disperse on the platform (b). We observe whether bystanders assist the confederate in collecting her possessions (c)._\n",
    "\n",
    "Here were the contents of the phone calls:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - In the regressive gender attitude condition, the confederate expresses disappointment with her sister, who has decided to get a job rather than stay at home and take care of her husband and kids. The confederate states that she believes her role as a woman is to stay at home and take care of her family.\n",
    "> - In the progressive attitude condition, the confederate expresses her approval of her sister’s decision to get a job rather than stay home and take care of her husband and kids. She states that she believes that women should not sacrifice their careers to stay at home and take care of their family.\n",
    "> - In the neutral control condition, the confederate has a conversation of roughly equal length about an innocuous matter unrelated to her attitudes regarding women and of no sociopolitical valence.\n",
