    "In this notebook, we will analyze some data from Arman Catterson's Psych 101 course, where they went over the psychological phenomenon of \"anchoring.\" According to Wikipedia: \"Anchoring is a cognitive bias whereby an individual's decisions are influenced by a particular reference point or anchor.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, students guessed the maximum speed of a house cat in miles per hour. In one condition, the \"high\" condition, students were prompted with the message \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Is the maximum speed of an average house cat FASTER or SLOWER than **3** miles per hour?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In the other condition, the \"low\" condition, students were prompted with\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Is the maximum speed of an average house cat FASTER or SLOWER than **40** miles per hour?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The student then had to provide an estimate for the speed of a house cat. We want to learn: did the anchoring have an effect on students' estimates? Let's assume that students were randomly assigned to each group.\n",
